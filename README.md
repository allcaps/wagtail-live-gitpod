Steps:

1. Click the ``Open in Gitpod`` button.
2. Relax: a development environment with an active Wagtail Live site will be created for you.
3. Login at `/admin/` with username `admin` and password `changeme`.
4. Navigate to the Live Blog Page _edit view_ at `/admin/pages/4/edit/`.
5. Open a second window with the Live Blog Page at `/live-blog/`

When you edit and publish, `/live-blog/` updates automatically.

TODO:

- Add `webapp` to add messages quickly.

Note: The long polling publisher is used. It is quick to set up. Wagtail Live provides other publishers that perform better.
